                            <h2>About Us</h2>
                            <b>Here at JW Repair&Replace we are founded on the 7 army values</b>
                            <p><u><b>Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, Personal Courage</b></u></p>
                            <p>
                                Since 2010 when this adventure began I was serving in the National Guard attending Indiana University enrolled in ROTC. What began as a part time venture for a little extra 
                                money for school quickly began to show a greater potential. 2011 Rolls around and I was deployed to Afghanistan where I drove a husky for the US Army as a combat engineer to 
                                locate and render safe roadside bombs. Having been through the roughest deployment in Indiana National guard history losing 6 of my friends in combat I came home a mess and 
                                needing structure that I had come to rely on and a squad I could call family. After a few years of searching for my calling. Navigating the VA Healthcare system I was able to 
                                meet a group of rock chip repair techs in Salt Lake City Utah (Alpha Glass Solutions) and worked hard to finally negotiate ownership of this enterprise. 
                                My mission is simply to provide the best service in Autoglass including providing disabled veterans like myself, and current reservists with a place that understands their 
                                unique needs as an employer and friend. We are a family as much . We utilize the latest software (local to Utah), Equipment (also local to Utah) and materials that are sourced 
                                ethically as well as held to the highest standard. With a repair time of 10-15 minutes and a safe drive away time on windshield replacements we have you in and out in a quick and 
                                safe manner. Currently we offer mobile services at no additional fee. Rock chip repair, Headlight Restoration, Windshield replacement, we glue on rear view mirrors and provide ADAS
